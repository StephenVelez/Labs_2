    "The pendulum was able to closely approach an oscillation time of one second because of the increase in the mass. In this case the mass was distrubuted mostly at the bottom. Weight, and center of mass can affect the movement of a pendulum. This demonstration showed how changing the momenet of intertia was able to obtain a lower angular momentum. "
